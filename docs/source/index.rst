Python STL
==========

``stl`` is a Python library for reading and writing 3D geometry data written
in both the binary and ASCII variants of the STL ("STereo Lithography") format.

STL is commonly used in preparing solid figures for 3D printing and other kinds
of automatic manufacturing, and is a popular export format for 3D CAD
applications.

(This library has nothing to do with the C++ Standard Template Library.)
